to notice problems with some of my Vim plug-ins. The problems were due to the fact that the Google
Drive folder has a space in it. So instead of doing what a good person should probably do and figure
out why Vim wasn’t escaping the space in the folder name I tried to just remove the space. A quick
scan of Google Drive preferences didn’t show any signs of the ability to change the folder name and
when I tried to rename it in Finder I got an error. It turns out you just have to close the Google
Drive app and then rename&nbsp;it.</p>

network) to a box file I ran into a problem. The issue was that when I tried to use that box file the
host-only network would not&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>With a little investigating I realized the problem was caused by the device name for the network
adapter being <code>eth2</code> instead of <code>eth1</code>. Vagrant uses <code>eth1</code> in the host-only network interface
defined in the <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> file. Since <code>eth1</code> network interface doesn’t
exist (it is <code>eth2</code>) our host-only network does not&nbsp;work.</p>

away from web development for under a year (I’ve been more focused on the Dev and DevOps of my
company’s cross-platform mobile apps for the last 11-months) and its amazing how much new cool shit
is out. That includes the blogging framework <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress 2.0</a> I am using for this&nbsp;site.</p>
