After I recently moved all my local software project's repos into my Google Drive folder I started
to notice problems with some of my Vim plug-ins. The problems were due to the fact that the Google
Drive folder has a space in it. So instead of doing what a good person should probably do and figure
out why Vim wasn't escaping the space in the folder name I tried to just remove the space. A quick
scan of Google Drive preferences didn't show any signs of the ability to change the folder name and
when I tried to rename it in Finder I got an error. It turns out you just have to close the Google
Drive app and then rename it.
